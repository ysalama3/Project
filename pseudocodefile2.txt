1. Preparing input file for PyRate
-The PyRate program requires a specific format for the input data. A correctly formatted 
input file can be generated using an R function provided in the script ‘pyrate_utilities.
r’ starting from a table with the fossil occurrence data. 
-All fossil occurrences need to be provided in a table (a tab-delimited text file), with 
species names, their status ("extant" or "extinct"), and minimum and maximum ages 
as the columns. The minimum and maximum ages commonly correspond to the 
temporal boundaries of the stage a particular fossil is assigned to and are generally 
available from the databases. At present, PyRate can not deal with missing 
information in these four columns, so make sure that you remove these entries
beforehand. One additional column may be added providing a trait value, if available,
 which can be used in the birth-death analysis (note that here, missing data are allowed,
 and should be given as NA). 

pseudocode: 

formated_file = extract species names + their status ("extant" or "extinct") +  minimum and maximum ages
for all lines with missing values
       remove them from my data file

my_traits = sort uniq species + extract corresponding traits

for every species in apefile.csv 
         append a corresponding trait value
        if trait data doesnt exist 
         print "NA"
        else:
         print "species name + uniq trait"
