chosen animal: Ape- Hominoidae
My plan:
1.Extract the number of unique species
2.Plot diversity of group though time in R
3.Plot the stratigraphic record of genera or families in data set 
4.Plot the occurrences of fossil species in python 
5. Use your occurrence data to calculate speciation and extinction rates through time using the program
Pyrate after formatting data appropriately
